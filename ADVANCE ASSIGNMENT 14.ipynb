    "Ans: A=A+1 evaluates to finding A, adding 1 to it. Then storing the value again in variable A. This expression makes Python to look for memory holder of 'a' twice. But A+=1 simply means value of A is to incremented by 1. As memory address has to be identified once, += leads to faster operation."
