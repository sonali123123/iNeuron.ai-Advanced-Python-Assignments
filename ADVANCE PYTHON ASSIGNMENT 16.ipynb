    "Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Regular Expressions, also known as regex or regexp, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of if/else statements. Regular expressions are a powerful feature of any language and solve a particular class of problems extraordinarily well. They can be used to validate user input, extract relevant data from a string, or even modify a string based on its contents."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Both (ab)c+ and a(bc)+ are valid patterns. The difference between both these patterns is that in (ab)c+ ab is a group whereas in a(bc)+ bc is a group. Capturing groups are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are created by placing the characters to be grouped inside a set of parentheses."

Range in Regular Expressions Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a ‘-‘, for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59."

    "\n",

    "\n",

Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but re.match() searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found.

Using Character set in square Brackets searches for all the character set in the square bracket and if match is found, it returns it."

When one wants to match a literal backslash, it must be escaped in the regular expression. With raw string notation, this means r\"\\\". Without raw string notation, one must use 4 times back slashes"
